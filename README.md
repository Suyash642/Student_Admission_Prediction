## Student-Admission-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning 
This project analyze the dataset from  https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions and predicts if a student will get an admission (on based on his/her GRE score, TOEFL score and University rating, CGPA) to university or not. 

This is a classification problem. I have implemented following parts in this project.

- Importing Dataset 
- Data Visualization and Correction 
- Data analysis with graphs using Seaborn and matplotlib 
- Predict the accuracy using machine learning algorithms. 
- Find the overall accuracy with different Sklearn Machine learning modules like 'Linear Regression' , 'Decision Tree Classifier' , 'Random Forest Classifier'.  

See the Jupyter Notebook for more details about code.
